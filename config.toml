<b>Welcome to my personal website!</b>  
  
This space is a collection of some of the works I have completed so far, from my time in South Sudan responding to the on-going crisis, to my Master in GIS at Edinburgh. You will also find other data explorations mainly with R.   
     
     
<b>A little about me...</b>
  
Dynamic and energetic I am very passionate about the projects I get involved in. I am always looking for new projects to embark on which will challenge my brain bringing out my inventiveness, creativity and imagination to find the best solution.   
Strongly believing that <i>“Together we stand, alone we fall”</i> I always collaborate in a profitable way with my team members, often building over time strong friendships.  
  
Happy exploring and get in touch if you want to know more!    
</br>
